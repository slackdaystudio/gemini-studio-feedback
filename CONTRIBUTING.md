# Contributing to Gemini Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Gemini Studio! üéâ

## How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible using our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

**Good bug reports include:**
- A clear, descriptive title
- Exact steps to reproduce the issue
- What you expected vs. what actually happened
- Screenshots or videos if relevant
- Your environment (platform, browser, device)

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome! Please use our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and:
- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Describe your proposed solution clearly
- Consider how it fits with existing features
- Share your use case - how would this help your games?

### üí¨ Participating in Discussions

Not every contribution needs to be an issue! [Discussions](https://github.com/slackdaystudio/gemini-studio-feedback/discussions) are great for:
- Asking questions
- Sharing how you use Gemini Studio
- Proposing ideas that need community input
- Helping other users

## Community Guidelines

### Be Kind and Constructive

- **Assume good intentions** - we're all here to make Gemini Studio better
- **Provide context** - help us understand your perspective
- **Stay on topic** - keep discussions relevant
- **Be patient** - we're a small team juggling many priorities

### Quality Over Quantity

- **Search before posting** - your question might already be answered
- **One issue per report** - don't combine multiple bugs or features
- **Be specific** - vague requests are hard to act on
- **Follow up** - if we ask for more info, please respond

## What Happens After You Submit?

1. **We review** - All submissions are reviewed by the team
2. **We label** - Issues get tagged (bug, enhancement, question, etc.)
3. **We prioritize** - Critical bugs get fast-tracked, features get evaluated
4. **We respond** - You'll hear from us, even if it's just acknowledgment
5. **We implement** - When something gets built, we'll update the issue

## Recognition

Contributors who provide valuable feedback, detailed bug reports, or great feature ideas will be acknowledged in our release notes (with permission).

## Questions?

If you're unsure about something, just ask! Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/slackdaystudio/gemini-studio-feedback/discussions) or add a comment to an existing issue.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We're committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity.

### Our Standards
