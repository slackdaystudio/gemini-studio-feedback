# Welcome to the Gemini Studio Community! 🎉

Hello and welcome! Whether you just discovered Gemini Studio or you've been with us since the early days, we're genuinely excited to have you here.

## What Is This Space?

This is **your space** to help shape Gemini Studio. Every bug you report makes the app more stable. Every feature you request helps us understand what matters to real players and GMs. Every discussion teaches us something new about how you use our tools.

## Why Your Feedback Matters

We're a small team building tools for a game we love, and we can't do it without you. You see edge cases we'd never think of. You use features in creative ways we never imagined. You catch bugs before they affect hundreds of users.

**You're not just reporting issues—you're helping build something better for the entire Gemini community.**

## What We're Working On

Right now, Gemini Studio includes:
- **Character Creation Wizard** - Step-by-step character building
- **Character Sheet** - Full character management with upkeep tracking
- **Mobile Import** - Bring your mobile app characters to the web
- **Print System** - Professional character sheet printing

But we're just getting started! Your feedback directly influences our roadmap.

## How to Get the Most Out of This Repo

### 🐛 **Found a Bug?**
Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/slackdaystudio/gemini-studio-feedback/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). The more details you provide, the faster we can fix it. Screenshots are worth a thousand words!

### 💡 **Have an Idea?**
Use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/slackdaystudio/gemini-studio-feedback/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Tell us the **problem** you're trying to solve, not just the solution. Context helps us design better features.

### 💬 **Just Want to Chat?**
- **[Join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AWSdEQHwsn)** - Real-time chat with the community! Perfect for quick questions, sharing characters, discussing ideas, or just hanging out with fellow Gemini fans.
- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/slackdaystudio/gemini-studio-feedback/discussions)** - For longer-form conversations and ideas that need some thought.

### 👍 **Support Existing Ideas?**
Found an issue or feature request you care about? React with a 👍 and add your use case. We prioritize based on community interest.

## What to Expect

**We will:**
- ✅ Read every issue and discussion
- ✅ Respond to questions and clarifications
- ✅ Label and prioritize based on impact
- ✅ Update you when we ship fixes or features
- ✅ Be honest about timelines and tradeoffs

**We can't:**
- ❌ Implement every feature request (resources are limited)
- ❌ Fix every bug immediately (we prioritize by severity)
- ❌ Respond instantly (we're a small team with day jobs)

But we **promise** to listen, be transparent, and always respect your time and input.
